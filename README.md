# Web-Design-Challenge
This was an extremely difficult challenge due to the fact that class lessons on bootstrap were too short. This challenge required a lot of research and self-study to complete.

## Requirements
I have attempted to meet all the requirements.

## Bonus
I attempted some of the bonuses such as the bootswatch theme and the active visualisation navigation.

## Files
* All the html and css files are in the root directory.
* Images are in the Resources/assets/images/ folder.
* There is a PD Dataframe to HTML.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file in the root folder with the code used to generate the HTML file from the cities.csv file in the Resources folder.
